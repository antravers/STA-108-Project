# County Demographic Linear Regression

What influences serious crimes in the 440 of the most populous counties in the United States?

# Project Goals:

- For each geographic region, regress the number of serious crimes against 5 predictor variables
- Use AIC and BIC to select your regression model for each region
- With the regression model for each region:
   - Estimate a 90% confidence interval for the parameters
   - Using α = 0.01 compute the p-value for t-test
   - Using α = 0.05 compute the p-value for f-test
   - Obtain the residuals for each fitted model and prepare the diagnostic plots for each fitted model
